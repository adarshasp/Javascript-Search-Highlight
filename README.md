Javascript-Search-Highlight
===========================

Search and Highlight a javascript/jQuery solution to search a term within html page. 
-It also provided with preview and next feature like Chrome page search.
-Stop word filter is added to avoid highlighting of commonly used words ( a-z ,an ,was ,where etc )



Note:  I have taken the initial source code from  below stack overflow link . Original code had many bugs 
,previw ,next featured wasnt's working . I have fixed the bugs and added few more features to it.
